# Python_Ejemplos_1
 Ejemplos de código utilizados en las clases sobre Python que imparto en inglés en la universidad

- **a_Lists_example.py** 
Example of LISTS and methods

- **b_Ask_and_print_number.py**
This program asks the user to enter a number and then displays that number on the screen

- **c_Print_formats.py**
This program demonstrates various ways to use the print function in Python.
It shows how to print variables and text together using different formatting techniques,
including simple concatenation, the format() method, f-strings, and the % operator.

- **d_Add_list_of_numbers.py**
This program asks the user to input 5 integers and stores them in a list. It calculates the total sum of these numbers
and then prints the sum. Additionally, it prints out numbers from the list that are greater than 10.

- **e_Multiplication_table_FOR.py**
Program to generate a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10
This example demonstrates the use of nested for loops to calculate and print
the multiplication results in a structured format.

- **f_Lists_example2.py**
This program showcases common list operations in Python, illustrating how to manipulate lists.
Operations demonstrated include appending elements, inserting elements at specific positions,
sorting the list, removing elements by value, popping elements by index, reversing the list,
counting occurrences of an element, and finding an element's index. 

- **g_average_FUNCTION.py**
This program calculates the average temperature from a list of temperatures.
It demonstrates the use of functions, lists, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

- **h_ATM_example_IF_WHILE.py**
This program simulates a simple ATM system in Python. Users start with a balance of $1000
and can withdraw money in multiples of $100. The program checks if the withdrawal amount
is valid (a multiple of $100 and does not exceed the current balance). If the user attempts
to withdraw more than their balance or an invalid amount, an error message is displayed.
The loop continues until the user exits by entering '0'. This demonstrates basic use of
control flow with while, if, elif, and else statements in Python.

- **i_Temp_conversion_FUNCTIONS.py**
This program is designed to demonstrate the application of functions in Python for temperature conversion.
It allows the user to input a temperature and choose whether they want to convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit
or from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The program defines two functions, one for each conversion direction, and uses
conditional logic to execute the appropriate conversion based on user input. It showcases fundamental programming
concepts such as function definition, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and user input handling.

- **j_Lista_de_la_compra**
This program allows the user to create and manage a shopping list interactively.
The user can add items to the shopping list by entering the names of the items one by one.
To finish and see all the items added to the list, the user must enter '0'.
The program then displays the complete shopping list before ending its execution.
It is a simple but practical tool for keeping track of pending purchases.

- **k_calculadora_simple.py**
This program simulates a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations in sequence.
The user enters a number, selects an arithmetic operation (+, -, /, x), and enters another number.
The calculator executes the operation and waits for the next user input.
This process is repeated until the user enters '=' to display the result and end the program.
